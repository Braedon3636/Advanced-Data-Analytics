# Advanced-Data-Analytics
This repo is all of the work from the Advanced Data Analytics course from Google in one place and formatted to be straightforward and easy to access for proof of completion. All the work here is completed by me. Here all of my code, completed case study, vizualizations and more will be located. 
These topics range from basic Data cleaning to building complex Machine Learning models.

The Case study files are uploaded in their original Jupyter Notebook formats for cleaner aesthetic and the Completed Notebooks folder of assignments are uploaded in PDF for more emphasis on the code itself for future refrencing or replication.
