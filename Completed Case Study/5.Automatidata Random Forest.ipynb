    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?** \n",
    "\n",
    "This model would be acceptable to use as its scores are high across the board, with an f1 score of 0.7369. It's accuracy is 0.7048. I would recommend having an alpha test to see how it works with new incoming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is not easy to understand as to why it makes the predictions it does, it's very accurate but how it comes to that accuracy is a bit hard to decifer. It shows VendorID is the most important factor in its predictions of tipping, so I'm understanding that it's the actual Vendors themselves on which has better services in which then the customer would provide better tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "If possible I would want data of overall customer satisfaction from each Vendor, then see the actual tip amounts vs. the satisfaction of each person. Then include the distance, overall charges, and track the cash tips if that was possible. There are many ways I could continue to improve this model if there was more data present.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Features to take all past tips including cash and implement that into the learning as well and then classify each customer by Vendor. With satisfaction data provided I could also make it that much more accurate and have an explination as to why Vendor is such a large factor in making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
